# pymockdata

A Python library for generating mock data and exporting it in various formats.


## Motivation

In various cases I needed real-looking generated data for tests and presentations and I thought that I might build a tool
that generates such data and exports it to various formats such as HTML, XML, CSV, JSON, etc. or even exporting it directly into a database.
